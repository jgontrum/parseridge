# Installation

Please follow the instructions on this page to set up the parseridge toolkit on you machine.

!!! note
    The toolkit requires at least Python 3.6 and can be installed using [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/).
    Developing new parsing algorithms requires to work directly with the provided code, therefore
    we do not plan a PyPI package release at the moment.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:jgontrum/parseridge.git
cd parseridge
poetry install
```
